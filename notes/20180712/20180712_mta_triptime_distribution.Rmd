## Getting Station Information

```{r getting-station-info}
# Generate edges between stations
trips <- stop_times %>% extract(trip_id, "route", regex=".*_.*_(.*)\\.\\..*", remove = FALSE)
trip_edges <- trips %>% mutate(prev_stop_id = ifelse(lag(trip_id) == trip_id, lag(stop_id), NA))
edges <- trip_edges %>% select(route, stop_id, prev_stop_id) %>% distinct()
# create stations dataframe with line, stop_id, stop_name
stations <- edges %>% left_join(station_data, by = c("stop_id"="stop_id")) %>% select(line=route, stop_id, stop_name)

```
## Express vs Local train Distribution

- Filter through all local and express train trips between two stations. 
- Calculate the time between two stations (trip time) for all trip across the day
- Compare the differences in histogram

```{r}
# Helper Function to Determine if Day is Weekend
isWeekend <- function(day_of_week) {
  ifelse(day_of_week == "Saturday" | day_of_week == "Sunday", T, F)
}

stops <- stations %>%
  filter(line == "1", grepl(sprintf("%s$", "S"), stop_id)) %>%
  unique()

# find trip time during 96th station and 14th station

plot_local_express <- function(local_line, express_line, start_stop_id, end_stop_id)
{
  # local train
  local_train <- subway_data %>%
    filter(stop_mta_id == start_stop_id | stop_mta_id == end_stop_id,
           route_mta_id == local_line) %>%
    mutate(day_of_week = weekdays((departure_time)),
           hour = hour(departure_time)) %>%
    filter(isWeekend(day_of_week) == F, hour > 6, hour < 20) %>%
    left_join(stops, by = c("stop_mta_id" = "stop_id")) %>%
    group_by(realtime_trip_id) %>% 
    arrange(desc(departure_time)) %>%
    mutate(diff = (first(departure_time) - last(departure_time))/60)
  
  # plot for local line
  plot_local <- local_train %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=diff)) + geom_histogram()

  # express train
  express_train <- subway_data %>%
    filter(stop_mta_id == start_stop_id | stop_mta_id == end_stop_id,
           route_mta_id == express_line) %>%
    mutate(day_of_week = weekdays(departure_time),
           hour = hour(departure_time)) %>%
    filter(isWeekend(day_of_week) == F, hour > 6, hour < 20) %>%
    left_join(stops, by = c("stop_mta_id" = "stop_id")) %>%
    group_by(realtime_trip_id) %>%
    arrange(desc(departure_time)) %>%
    mutate(diff = (first(departure_time) - last(departure_time))/60)
  
  # plot for express train
  plot_express <- express_train %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=diff)) + geom_histogram()

  # code for combining plots as per: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21192002/how-to-combine-2-plots-ggplot-into-one-plot
  local_train$group <- "local"
  express_train$group <- "express"
  
  combined <- rbind(local_train, express_train)
  
  combined_plot <- ggplot(combined, aes(x=diff, group=group, col=group, fill=group)) +
    geom_histogram(alpha = 0.8, position = "identity")
  # NOTE: can get intersecting distributions by running the code below 
  # geom_density(alpha = 0.8, position = "identity")
  
  return(combined_plot)
}

plot_local_express ("1", "2", "120S", "132S")
```

## Introducing one stop transfer
- Explore a slightly different route on this line that could use either the local or a combination of the local and express with a transfer in betweenï¿½(e.g., 18th to 96th st.)
- Compare the distribution of trip times using the local to those using the local + express

```{r}

#express stops
express2_stop <- c("120S", "127S")
local1_stop <- c("127S", "131S")

express_transfer <- subway_data %>% 
  filter(stop_mta_id =="120S" | stop_mta_id == "127S",
         route_mta_id == "2" ) %>%
  left_join(stops, by = c("stop_mta_id" = "stop_id")) %>%
  group_by(realtime_trip_id) %>% 
  arrange (desc(departure_time)) %>%
  mutate(diff= (first(departure_time)-last(departure_time))/60) %>%
  View()

#local stops
local_transfer <- subway_data %>% 
  filter(stop_mta_id =="127S" | stop_mta_id == "131S",
         route_mta_id == "1" ) %>%
  left_join(stops, by = c("stop_mta_id" = "stop_id")) %>%
  group_by(realtime_trip_id) %>% 
  arrange (desc(departure_time)) %>%
  mutate(diff= (first(departure_time)-last(departure_time))/60) %>%
  View()

#wait time calculation
transfer <- rbind(local_transfer,express_transfer)

#find the first 1 train after the 2 train departure time


```

## Compute Trip Time

```{r compute-trip-time}

# NOTE: DEBUG CODE  
# start_station <- "120S"

compute_trip_time <- function (start_station, start_line, transfer_station, transfer_line, end_station, start_time) {
    
    # find first trips on the start_line at the start_station that depart after start_time
    first_train <- subway_data %>%
      filter(stop_mta_id == start_station,

      filter(ymd_hms(departure_time) > ymd_hms(start_time))
    
    # get the trip_id of the first trip after the depart_time
    first_trip_id <- first(first_train$realtime_trip_id)
    
    # TODO: add arrival_time to first_train
    
    # find the arrival time for trip_id at transfer station
    transfer_arrival_time <- subway_data %>%
      filter(realtime_trip_id == first_trip_id,
             stop_mta_id == transfer_station) %>%

    transfer_train <- subway_data %>%

    transfer_trip_id <- first(transfer_train$realtime_trip_id)
    
    # TODO: add arrival_time to transfer_train
    
    # compute the time difference of when our train arrives at end_station and start_time
    dest_arrival_time <- subway_data %>%
